The "15 puzzle" is a sliding square puzzle introduced by Sam Loyd in 1878. 
It consists of 15 squares numbered from 1 to 15 which are placed in a box 
leaving one position out of the 16 empty. The goal is to reposition the 
squares from a given arbitrary starting arrangement by sliding them one 
at a time into a configuration, where the squares are ordered by their
numbers. For more details see:

Our model stores the "state" of the puzzle in a global array named a,
current position of the empty square is stored in global variables x and y,
numbered from upper-left corner, the coordinates of which are (0, 0).
Process P then "executes" the moves, one transition corresponds to one move.
Our model allows to adjust the size of the puzzle to n x m for arbitrary
natural numbers n and m. However, the LTL formulas refer only to the original
4 x 4 version.
