  Implementation of algorithms:
    andersons.mdve
    bakery.mdve
    mcs.mdve
    peterson.mdve
  Properties:
    prop.mltl 

Important states of implementations:
  NCS - non-critical section
  CS - critical section

Important parameters of implementations:
  N - number of processes
  LOOPS - indicates whether processes can loop in non-critical section or not (i.e. whether there is a rule of the form NCS -> NCS)

Important variables in implementations:
  byte in_critical - incremented by a process entering CS, and decremented by a process leaving CS
  byte active - each process sets to 1 during each step (indicates "activity" of a process)
  byte waiting[N] - when a process desires to enter CS (i.e. it leaves NCS) then it sets waiting[$1] := 1, and when a process enters CS then it sets waiting[$1] := 0

Parameters of properties:
  L - number of processes

Properties:
  1) (naive) for each process holds, that whenever it waits for CS then it is eventually in CS
  2) for each process holds, that if it is active infinitely often, then if it waits for CS then it is eventually in CS
  3) (naive) each process is infinitely often in CS
  4) (almost naive) for each process holds, that if it is infinitely often active, then it is inifnitely often in CS
  5) for each process holds, that if it is inifintely often active and waiting for CS, then it is inifinitely often in CS
  6) there is allways at most one process in CS
  7) for each process P_i where i>0 holds, that the following situation never occurs: the process P_0 waits for CS, and P_i is twice in CS
while P_0 is still waiting
