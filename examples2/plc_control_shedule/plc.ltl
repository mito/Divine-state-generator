Atomic propositions
-------------------
#define b3sol	(B3 == sol70C)
#define b3empty	(B3 == cempty)
#define end	(time>=maxtime)
#define nrbatches	(batches<5)

Properties
----------
(1) container B3 is infinitely often full and infinitely often empty
#property GF(b3sol || end) && GF(b3empty || end)

(2) number of manufactured batches (from B3 to B4)
#property G(nrbatches)

(3) the time is still progressing
#property Fend
