Description:
 The system consists of an arbitrary number of lifts. Each lift supports one wheel of a vehicle. The system is operated by means of buttons on the lifts. Lifts are connected by a bus. The model describes the startup phase and the up/down synchronization mechanism.

Parameters:
N = number of lifts
ENV = environment
	0 = simple environment with just three pressed buttons
	1 = environment with just one press of set_ref button and arbitrary combination of up/down buttons
	2 = general environment

State space size info:

N = 2 ... small
N = 3 ... approx 10^5
N = 4 ... approx 10^6

(ENV 0 < ENV 1 < ENV 2)

Formulas:

#property (GF pressedup_0) -> (GF moveup)
satisfied only for ENV=0

#property G (pressedup_0 -> F moveup)
not satisfied; nice counterexample for ENV=0 (for others there is a trivial cycle)

#property  ((! moveup) U pressedup_0) || G (! moveup)
not satisfied

#property  ((! moveup) U (myloop(x,0,decr(N),`pressedup_`'x',` || '))) || G (! moveup)
satisfied
