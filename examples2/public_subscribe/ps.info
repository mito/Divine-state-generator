Publish / Subscribe Notification protocol
-----------------------------------------

Modeled by Vladimir Lapacek according to an article "Model Checking
Publish/Subscribe Notification for thinkteam". Note that the differencies
between ProMeLa and DiVinE native modeling language didn't allow to model
the protocol faithfully.

Comments

There appeared to be a problem with the verification of a safety property
(4), stating that a process cannot be (falsely) notified without
registering to a file. The original model in ProMeLa suffered by the same
problem. After some experiments with the original model and the property
described in the article, I concluded, that the problem occurs when comes
a notification - process reaches state doneNotify and stays there until
doneUnregister is reached. So the subformula doneNotify -> !(!(doneGet ||
doneRegister) U ) is satisfied in one step. The same problem applies to
the property (5).

Properties (6) and (7) are suggested as replacement for (4) and (5)
