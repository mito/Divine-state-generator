Driving Philosophers
--------------------
Designed by Jiri Simsa. Motivated by the model described in "The Driving
Philosophers" by S. Baehmi, R. Baldoni, R. Guerraoui and B. Pochon. It
allows for mutual exclusion of processes accessing several resources.

Parameters
----------
N ... the number of processes (default 2) 
K ... the number of resources (default 2)
MUTEX == 0 : no mutual exclusion
         1 : mutual exclusion (default)
FAIR == 0 : processes can starve (default)
        1 : no starvation (future work)
R ... the number of rounds (default 10) 
      is meaningful only if FAIR == 1
DELTA ... upper bound for starving (default 10) 
          is meaningful only if FAIR == 1
