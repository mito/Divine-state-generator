	Changed:
		store/clusters (1.5), "Exp", lines: +15 -0

	Add parsecs cluster. Does not work yet, the divine installation there
	needs to be updated to current cvs, with --enable-gui (since the
	helper programs are not built otherwise).
	
2006-01-17 10:23  xrockai

	Changed:
		src/divine/common/Algorithm.java (1.7), "Exp", lines: +1 -1
		src/divine/common/Cluster.java (1.5), "Exp", lines: +1 -1

	Abort on server shall set the dirty flag on the algorithm, so that the
	client actually receives the updated status. Also preserve the output
	of an aborted algorithm, just append "Aborted" to the end of Output tab.
	
2006-01-17 08:55  xrockai

	Changed:
		src/divine/client/AlgorithmPanel.java (1.3), "Exp", lines: +12 -5

		src/divine/common/Request.java (1.2), "Exp", lines: +3 -1
		src/divine/common/Wired.java (1.2), "Exp", lines: +19 -10

	Resolve the performance problems with client. Due to the way how java handles
	Strings, the unprefix method was roughly O(m*n^3) in n number of lines per value
	and m number of values. It should now run in O(m*n). Some logarithms may be
	involved due to the map lookups. Overall result roughly in O(m*n*log(m)) if
	i count right.

2006-01-15 12:12  xrockai

	Added:
		dwi-cluster-load (1.1)
	Changed:
		Makefile.am (1.12), "Exp", lines: +3 -2

	Implement the cluster-gateway portion of the cluster monitor. This will
	be run through dwi-run and the input is list of hostnames to check. Output
	is a map hostname: load.
	
2006-01-15 11:37  xrockai

	Changed:
		dwi-prepare (1.2), "Exp", lines: +15 -6

	Support .pml format, pass around absolute paths since mpirun tends
	to break otherwise. Pass log/report arguments by default.
	
2006-01-11 09:49  xrockai

	Added:
		build/dummy (1.1)

	Add a dummy file to ensure that CVS does not prune the build directory.
	
2006-01-09 21:26  xrockai

	Changed:
		store/clusters (1.3), "Exp", lines: +1 -6

	Update clusters file to match current divineuser@anna setup.
	
2006-01-09 21:17  xrockai

	Deleted:
		client-start (1.3)
		server-start (1.4)
	Added:
		server-start.sh (1.1)

	A new script suitable for running the server in real (non-testing) situations.
	This shall be used to run the server on divineuser@anna.fi.muni.cz. It currently
	uses the in-build-tree copy of class files, no standalone server so far.
	
2006-01-09 21:11  xrockai

	Added:
		make-client-zip.sh (1.1)

	Add a script to build a zipfile with all required files (currently a
	jarfile, truststore and a shell script to run the client).

	There is a copy of the resulting zip available on:
	http://lorien.mornfall.net:8012/m/divine-dwi-0.1.zip

	I will add an README with some basic instructions on how
	to run the client.
	
2006-01-07 14:13  xrockai

	Changed:
		dwi-run.cpp (1.6), "Exp", lines: +37 -21

	Implement periodic updates of algorithm instance output. Allows for
	plotting the logs in nearly real time.
	
2006-01-07 14:11  xrockai

	Changed:
		store/passwd (1.2), "Exp", lines: +0 -2

	Use the new format here, too. Makes server not choke in default (pristine cvs)
	setup.

2006-01-03 00:35  xrockai

	Added:
		README (1.1)
		dwi-prepare (1.1)
	Changed:

		src/divine/tests/AlgorithmTest.java (1.4), "Exp", lines: +2 -2

		store/algorithms (1.3), "Exp", lines: +7 -16
		store/clusters (1.2), "Exp", lines: +6 -5

	Merge offline changes:
	* wrote a README which includes a short summary of working features
	  and an incomplete todo list plus some random notes
	* dropped lots of obsolete code
	* dropped all the .form files
	* NameMap wire format does not need name: to be included explicitly anymore
	* NameMap.Element is now a class not interface (code reuse)
	* NameMap elements now form a sort of object tree (where children are
	  always grouped into NameMaps which are themselves named, so we can
	  construct named paths in the tree)
	* Property and Model types and Algorithm.Instance states are now properly
	  (de)serialized
	* both client and server now use User to manage the object tree
	* new class Cluster.Executable, for objects that are executable on a cluster
	  - Algorithm.Instance is derived from Cluster.Executable
	  - the class provides a mechanism to invoke dwi-run on the cluster
	    ond feed data to it
	* introduced new helper script dwi-prepare
	  - simplifies parameter handling in dwi a lot
	  - this is executed through dwi-run, with all input data like algorithm
	    name, arguments, model or property and writes out a shell script
		that when executed carries out all the tasks of algorithm invocation:
		combine or preprocess or bytecode compiler for promela and the
		algorithm itself with translated arguments
	* (re)implemented change polling in client -- server keeps track of "dirty"
	  tasks and can send them on demand to the client (clearing their dirty
	  status); dirty is set when task state changes
	* reimplemented client font change mechanism
	* new user interface for setting up Tasks:
	  - arbitrary number of Algorithm.Instances can be added
	  - each Algorithm.Instance is assigned to a cluster individually
	* algorithm output is currently presented as flat text
	* task abortion (relies on mpirun to reap its children -- seems to work)
	* reimplemented panel locking mechanism
	* fixed tree syncing in client to not interfere with selection and
	  expansion status of the GUI tree
	* fixed document change handling so that changing model or property
	  is reflected immediately in the client's object tree -- therefore
	  storing the model will store what are you looking at
	* reimplement object renaming (based on copy+delete)
	* various code cleanups and refactors
	* update the example store/ files to current format
	
2005-12-21 10:08  xrockai

	Changed:
		dwi-run.cpp (1.4), "Exp", lines: +1 -0

	Fix compilation on some systems (should fix Jirik's compile).
	
2005-12-21 05:07  xrockai

	Changed:
		store/algorithms (1.2), "Exp", lines: +3 -0

	Add distr_reachability (good for testing).
	
2005-12-21 04:23  xrockai

	Changed:
		dwi-run.cpp (1.3), "Exp", lines: +38 -10

	The helper can now collect and send back the outputs. This means the runner
	is nearly complete. Fix up formatting, too :).
	
2005-12-20 21:03  xrockai

	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/NameMapTest.java (1.5), "Exp", lines: +19 -4

	Add object ownership right to NameMap. Much more reliable. All bugs
	related to objects losing their parents should be eliminated now.
	
2005-12-20 19:45  xrockai

	Changed:
		dwi-run.cpp (1.2), "Exp", lines: +15 -4

	Be more verbose (on stderr). More failure modes. Create directories with
	mode 0770 not 0700.
	
2005-12-20 19:33  xrockai

	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/AlgorithmTest.java (1.3), "Exp", lines: +1 -1

	Compile.
	
2005-12-20 13:54  xrockai

	Changed:
		server-start (1.3), "Exp", lines: +1 -1

	Since the server main() method got cut down considerably, the arguments
	are no longer needed. Some argument parsing will be reinsated later.
	
2005-12-20 13:54  xrockai

	Added:
		store/algorithms (1.1)
		store/clusters (1.1)
		store/passwd (1.1)

	Add a server configuration example. Server needs those files to be
	able to work. The algorithm/cluster/password lists are read from
	there. The location is currently hardcoded to
	$HOME/divine/dwi/store. This will be made configurable at some point.
	
2005-12-20 13:52  xrockai

	Deleted:
		conf/algorithms.dtd (1.2)
		conf/algorithms.xml (1.3)
		conf/computers.xml (1.4)
		conf/users.xml (1.2)

	The XML files are no longer used. Server uses a bunch of flat text files
	to store data (using the wire format).
	
2005-12-20 13:29  xrockai

	Added:
		dwi-run.cpp (1.1)
	Changed:
		Makefile.am (1.10), "Exp", lines: +6 -0

	Implement (first part of) cluster-side helper program (runner).
	
2005-12-13 05:48  xrockai

	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/AlgorithmTest.java (1.2), "Exp", lines: +12 -0

	Implement the Algorithm(.Instance) split. This makes the server almost
	secure (still need to implement proper escape(), the current one is
	probably missing some cases). Argument handling is still somewhat
	broken.
	
2005-12-13 04:16  xrockai

	Added:
		ChangeLog (1.1)

	Create ChangeLog by perusing cvs2cl.
	
2005-12-13 02:44  xrockai

	Added:
		src/divine/tests/AlgorithmTest.java (1.1)
	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/CommonSuite.java (1.4), "Exp", lines: +1 -0

	First go at shell escaping in Algorithm.
	
2005-12-10 02:17  xrockai

	Changed:
		Makefile.am (1.9), "Exp", lines: +3 -3

	Drop StopServer/StopSocket, this is definitely not the way to
	go. Update Makefile.am, the code should now compile by default out of
	CVS (without manual tweaking, yay!). From the major components, we are
	currently missing only the Runner i think. The rest should be fixing
	up bigger or smaller breakage and implementing secondary features.
	
2005-12-09 00:12  xrockai

	Added:
		src/divine/tests/UserTest.java (1.1)
	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/CommonSuite.java (1.3), "Exp", lines: +1 -0

	Implement User.Store, used via User's store() method, which implements
	Wired.Interface allowing you to read User data from file.
	
2005-12-08 18:51  xrockai

	Changed:
		Makefile.am (1.8), "Exp", lines: +5 -27

	Refactoring continues. Both server and client now compile and login
	almost works (apart from the detail that the user database in server
	is broken currently, to be restorted).

	Summary of changes:
	- everything that compiles got converted to the new core set of
	  classes (model, task, ...)
	- ModelType and PropertyType are now nested in their "owner" classes:
	  Model.Type and Property.Type
	- JNewClient is now responsible for the object tree and object<->node
	  association, not the objects themselves
	- everything using the old protocol is now either converted to new or
	  commented out
	- (some things i have probably forgotten)

	Lots of things broken. Server databases will be fixed next, so that
	login and listings work again.
	
2005-12-08 00:21  xrockai

	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/PropertyTest.java (1.2), "Exp", lines: +15 -0

2005-12-07 19:13  xrockai

	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/ModelTest.java (1.2), "Exp", lines: +22 -0

	Implement dewiring of Model. This needed changes to Wired to get
	default type for map template. This is implemented as a special key in
	the template, called fromWire-template-default.
	
2005-12-07 18:41  xrockai

	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/NameMapTest.java (1.4), "Exp", lines: +29 -0

	Shift add/drop/rename functionality from Model to NameMap, it is not
	specific to properties at all and we'll want to use it in Property and
	Cluster as well. Test the new NameMap functions, too.
	
2005-12-07 18:21  xrockai

	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/NameMapTest.java (1.3), "Exp", lines: +5 -0

	Few more cases for the uniqueName test. Also check it's correct for
	names not present in the Map.
	
2005-12-07 18:19  xrockai

	Added:
		src/divine/tests/ModelTest.java (1.1)
	Changed:
		src/divine/tests/CommonSuite.java (1.2), "Exp", lines: +1 -0
		src/divine/tests/NameMapTest.java (1.2), "Exp", lines: +11 -5

	Add first Model test (test handling Properties). Add a test for
	NameMap.uniqueName() and fix the bug in it. Fix addProperty/setModel
	disagreement between Property and Model (renaming setModel to
	setModelInternal).

	Changed:
		Makefile.am (1.6), "Exp", lines: +2 -0

	New and even better serialisation implementation. I don't expect many
	changes to it anymore. The Request class needs to be ported over and
	so does the current client/server code. However, after adding few bits
	of convenience API, this should be pretty easy (lot easier than from
	the original code to current API).

	This also means that the serialisation of individual entities
	(algorithms, clusters, computers, etc.) can be reimplemeted,
	analogically to what happened to lower layer of he protocol. This is
	probably the last major step in general protocol reliability fixes.
