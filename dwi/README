(Re)Written by Peter Rockai <me@mornfall.net>. Based on code by
Vojtech Forejt.  License status of original code unclear. Parts
written anew are covered by 3-clause BSD (especially including
NameMap, Wired, Request classes and all tests).

WORKS:
- login, logout
- model and property manipulation
- storage of user data
- loading of algorithm and cluster descriptions
- making tasks as a set of tool invocations (on possibly different clusters)
- execution of tasks
- locking of items with results
- collecting tool results
- font size (killer feature)
- task abortion
- element paths and following automatic panel updates and tree selection
  persistence
- "event" list (algorithms finished and so)
- cluster load monitor
- serverless mode for client
- proper context menus, context toolbars
- remove the type comboboxes 
  - set model type at creation time
  - from file should create new model, 
  - only LTL properties should have their own nodes,
    state space and property process will only be
    available on the task setup combobox
- basic job, task UI

SHORTTERM
- improve the ui for tasks?
- profiles
- tool parameter input
- nicer result presentation:
  - counterexamples
  - report viewer
  - improve log viewer (maybe more longterm: show/hide columns, sort by column)
- more robust job handling
- reattaching of pbs in-progress jobs on worker restart
- a reservation/schedule/something tab for jobs, which shows where your job is in the PBS queue?

LONGTERM
- user, cluster and tool management (admin mode)
- timeout/keepalive?

PENDING RENAMES
dwi -> gui (?)

RUNNING
Currently, dwi server expects to find $HOME/divine/dwi/store and
$HOME/divine/dwi/store/user directories. It currently needs write
permission for the user directory, but store will be written in future
as well.

The store directory is expected to have 3 files in it: algorithms,
clusters and passwd. Example files included in CVS should be
self-explantory.
