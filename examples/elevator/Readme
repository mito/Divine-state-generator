Simple model of elevator serving N floors

parameters:
N = number of floors
K = size of buffer for environment requests
CONTROL =
  naive
  fifo
 (add more)

properties:
LTL:  if the elevator is called to the first floor, it will eventually arive there and open the door (should not be sat. by naive, by fifo OK, but needs fairness)
