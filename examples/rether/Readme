RETHER protocol (real-time Ethernet)

according to "Local model checking and protocol analysis" (STTT (1999) 2: 219-241)

parameters:
N - number of nodes
Slots - number of slots (bandwidth)
RT_slots - maximal number of slots for RT (should be < Slots)
ERROR - 0/1 the error is caused by ommision of one synchronization which leads to tricky error

properties:
- reachability of Bandwidth error_state and Node error_state
   (reachable by very nontrivial path for ERROR=1 version)
- ltl:
  - granted => RT action in next cycle 	OK
  - want => RT action in next cycle 	NO  (unless RT_Slots <=N or RT_Slots==Slots)
  - granted => RT action in this cycle	NO
  - always some more NRT action (of node1)	OK (only in correct version and if RT_Slots<Slots)
  - always some more RT action (of node0)	NO

size depends mainly on N:
N = 4 ... approx 15.000
N = 5 ... approx 50.000
N = 6 ... approx 150.000
