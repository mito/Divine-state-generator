 Mutual exclusion examples

all models are 'standarized' they have processes P_0, P_1, ... P_(n-1); which
have nodes NCS, wait, CS

nonparametrized:
- peterson (basic pet. protocol for 2 processes)

parametrized (for N processes, parameter LOOPS (0/1) says whether there should be loops in NCS):

- simple_token_ring
- peterson
- fischer (discrete time emulation of a real time protocol)


Properties:
- reachability: mutual exclusion between P_0, P_1 in CS; OK everywhere
- LTL: response (wait => CS), infinitely many CS
	depends on whether we allow selfloops and whether we use fair MC
